Health Issues And Medical Emergencies Have Now Become A Serious Concern Not Just In Rural Areas But Also In Urban Communities.
They Can Occur At Any Time And Anywhere.
The 'Golden Hour' Is Critical In Saving A Life Because A Delay In Treatment Can Result In Death.
With The Rising Frequency Of Road Accidents, Chronic Conditions Such As Heart Failure, And Pandemics, It Is Important That The Patient Arrives At The Hospital On Time.

To Make This Feasible, Our Website Provides The Following Major Features To Our Users:
Based On Their Present Location, Our Website Provides Them With The Number Of Vacant Beds In the Nearby Hospital. If The Nearest Hospital Does Not Have Any Vacant Beds, The User Can Search For The Next Nearest Hospital With Vacant Beds.
Not Only This, But Our Website Uses Our Location Feature To Lead The User/Ambulance To The Shortest Possible Route To The Hospital, Saving Time And Life.
Our Website Also Allows The User To Arrange An Appointment With The Hospital Of His Choice , Saving Time.
Furthermore, Our Website Displays The Location Of The Nearest Blood Bank As Well As The Availability Of Blood With Various Blood Groups, All Based On The Current Location To Ensure That Blood Is Available On Time. We also Help people find out the availability of Blood Camps nearby so that they can donate their blood with ease.
Further, We also allow Blood Camps to register themselves through our website.

On The Hospital Side, We Make Sure That All Of The Hospitals That Are Registered Keep All Of Their Information Up To Date, Whether It Is Related To The Blood Availability, Bed Availability, Or Other Appointment Specifics, In Order To Help Us In Achieving Our Purpose.
